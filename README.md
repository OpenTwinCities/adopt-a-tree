## Installation

### System Dependencies

- [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/)
- [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) plus development header files
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [libffi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libffi)

**Mac OS X**

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install git postgres node 
```

Note in the above we are fetching [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to handle system
dependencies.

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```
sudo apt-get install git postgresql libpq-dev nodejs nodejs-legacy npm libffi-dev
```

**Fedora/RHEL/CentOS**

```
sudo yum install git postgresql-server postgresql-devel nodejs npm libffi-devel patch 
sudo postgresql-setup initdb && sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service && sudo service postgresql start
```

#### Prep the Database

**Mac OS X**

First, open another terminal and start the database:

```
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
```

Then, create the adopta database user

```
createuser -d adopta
```

**Linux**

```
sudo -u postgres createuser -d adopta
```

As superuser, edit:

- `/etc/postgresql/{version number}/main/pg_hba.conf` in Ubuntu/Debian, or 
- `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` in Fedora

Find one of these lines:

```
local   all             postgres                                peer
local   all             all                                     peer
```

and add the following line right above it:

```
local   all             adopta                                  trust
```

Now, save and restart Postgres:

```
sudo service postgresql restart
```

### PhantomJS

[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) is used by tests

```
npm install -g phantomjs
```

### rbenv

rbenv and it's pluggins are installed via Git. Below are commands to run in
OS X or Linux for installing rbenv and a couple of useful plugins.

(Note that some systems use `~/.bash_profile` instead of `~/.bashrc`. Running
`ls -a ~ | egrep '(.bash_profile|.bashrc)'` should tell you which one to use.)

```
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-gem-rehash.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-gem-rehash
```

### Get the Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ballPointPenguin/adopt-a-tree.git
cd adopt-a-tree
```

### Install the Ruby

First, find out what version of Ruby Adopt-a-Tree runs in

```
rbenv version
```

Then, install whatever version of Ruby the above command just returned. This
part might take some time. 

```
rbenv install <version number> -k
```

### Install Gems and Create the Adopt-A-Tree Database

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:schema:load
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

### Additional Installation Resources

In case you have trouble with the above installation steps, you might want to
refer to the [Adopt-a-Hydrant Wiki](https://github.com/codeforamerica/adopt-a-hydrant/wiki/Adopta-Install-Notes) 
for detailed instructions on installation. You can also post a question to the
[Open Twin Cities Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/twin-cities-brigade).


## Usage

```
rails server
```

## Importing More Trees

Once or twice a year, the Minneapolis Park Board sends us a shapefile full of
trees to upload to Adopt-A-Tree. Here is the process for putting those on the
site:

1. Upload the shapefile to Open Twin Cities' Open Data Portal
2. Download a JSON version of the file from Open Twin Cities' Open Data Portal
3. Copy the JSON file to the Adopt-A-Tree server, using user `ubuntu`. Bill has
   keys.
4. Log into the Adopt-A-Tree server using user `ubuntu`
5. Back up the database using `pg_dump adopta_production > SOMEFILENAME`. You'll
   need to change users.
6. Open a rails console for production.
7. Delete all trees that have not been adopted `Thing.where(user_id: nil).destroy_all`
8. Exit the console, run rake db:trees:list_fields on the JSON file (see below)
9. run rake db:trees:import. Be sure RAILS_ENV=production.
10. Open a production rails console again and verify the trees have been imported.
11. Restart Adopt-A-Tree if the process died during the import.

When running `rails` or `rake`, you'll need to prepend `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec`

### Rake Tasks

Three rake tasks are available to help you import additional trees to the 
database, or to replace all tree data, from a GeoJSON file provided by Socrata.

To view a list of the names and indices of all fields in a file, run `rake db:trees:list_fields[PATH_TO_GEOJSON]`.
PATH_TO_GEOJSON can be relative or absolute.

```
$ rake db:trees:list_fields[db/trees.json]
0 - :sid
1 - :id
2 - :position
.
.
.
64 - x
65 - y
66 - species
```

For the import and replace tasks, you're going to need to know the column indices
for the 'id' (**not** :id), 'uniqueid', 'x', 'y', and 'species' columns.

To import additional trees into the database from a GeoJSON files, run `rake db:trees:import[PATH_TO_GEOJSON,ID_INDEX,UNIQUEID_INDEX,X_INDEX,Y_INDEX,SPECIES_INDEX]`:

```
rake db:trees:import[db/trees.json,8,9,64,65,66]
```

To completely replace the trees currently in the databse with the trees contained
in a GeoJSON file, run `rake db:trees:replace[PATH_TO_GEOJSON,ID_INDEX,UNIQUEID_INDEX,X_INDEX,Y_INDEX,SPECIES_INDEX]`:


```
rake db:trees:replace[db/trees.json,8,9,64,65,66]
```

## Deploying

Assuming you have SSH keys setup properly, deploy via:

    cap stage deploy
    cap production deploy

## Accessing Admin View

*Based on [Raleigh's Adopt-A-Hydrant installation notes](http://localwiki.net/raleigh/Adopta_App/Development?&docuredirected_from=raleigh%20adopta%20app/development).*

1. First, signup through the site.
2. Then open a terminal and start the rails console - `rails console`.
3. List all users - `User.all`
4. Find your user id in the list. For this example, assume it is '1'.
5. Search for your user - `a=User.find(1)`
6. Set the admin flag on your user - `a.admin = true`
7. Save your user - `a.save`
8. Go back to your browser, and visit localhost:3000/admin

### The Basics

First things first, there are a few things you should be familiar with:

 - The Command Line. Depending on your computer and the tools you use, you 
   might use the command line a little or a lot. Either way, it helps to know 
   how to use it a bit. 
    - Never used the Command Line before? Check out [this tutorial from Open Hatch to get started](http://openhatch.org/missions/shell/about).
    - Using Windows? Open Hatch also has [a tutorial focused on the Windows command line](http://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/).
 - Git and GitHub. Adopt-A-Tree uses these tools to manage our collaborative 
   coding. If you've never used git or GitHub before, you can search the 
   Internet and find a lot of good resources. You can also checkout these 
   couple of tutorials to get started:
    - [Install and Setup Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
    - [GitHub's Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/),
      which covers the on the standard flow for contributing code to projects on GitHub. 
  - Most of Adopt-A-Tree is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and 
    [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), 
    using [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). 
    Familiarity with other frameworks and libraries, such as [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) 
    (Ruby) and [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) (JavaScript) might also be helpful.
    And of course, [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and 
    [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

Don't worry if you're not comfortable with all of these things. Working on a 
project like Adopt-A-Tree is a great way to learn.

## Supported Ruby Version
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] Ruby version 2.1.0.

If something doesn't work on this version, it should be considered a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the version above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
